        <h2>Description</h2>
           <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>1.5 cups all-purpose flour</li>
               <li>3.5 teaspoons baking powder</li>
               <li>1/4 teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
               <li>1 cup of milk</li>
               <li>1 egg</li>
               <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
            </ul>
         <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
               <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
               <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
            </ol>
